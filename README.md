# Project 1 - Stacks  
Timeline: One week  
Tech: HTML, CSS, vanilla JS  
Description: A personal library app featuring search, filter, sort and local storage
Contribution Type: Personal project
Status: Completed
Retrospective: This was my first big project when I started learning JavaScript. After learning basic JS, I started following the Odin Project course for JS and really got into this project, coming up with extra features to work on. I know a lot of people look back at old code and cringe, but this remains one of my favorite projects because I feel like I did a lot with what little I knew back then. For example, I wrote my own filter method because I didn't know about the built-in method. I'm glad I was able to do this project before signing on to a bootcamp because it gave me in-depth practice with vanilla JS. One day I'd like to go back and refactor and see how much shorter I can make it.
