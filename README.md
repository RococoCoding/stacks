# Project 1 - Stacks  
**Timeline**: One week  
**Tech**: HTML, CSS, vanilla JS  
**Description**: A personal library app featuring search, filter, sort and local storage  
**Contribution Type**: Personal project  
**Status**: Completed  
**Retrospective**: This was my first big project when I started learning JavaScript. I was following the Odin Project course for JS and this project was to practice using object constructors, but I got really into it and came up with extra features to add and made it a lot more than I had intended at the start. I know a lot of people look back at old code and cringe, but this remains one of my favorite projects because I feel like I did a lot with what little I knew back then. For example, I wrote my own filter method because I didn't know about the built-in method. One day I'd like to go back and refactor and see how much shorter I can make it and maybe add a backend database so it doesn't solely rely on local storage.
