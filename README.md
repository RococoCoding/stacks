# Project 1 - Stacks  
Timeline: Written in a week about a month into learning JS.  
Tech: HTML, CSS, vanilla JS  
Description: A small library app featuring search, filter, sort and local storage. 
Contribution Type: Personal project.
Retrospective: I know a lot of people look back at old code and cringe, but this remains one of my favorite projects because I feel like I did a lot with what little I knew back then. For example, I wrote my own filter method because I didn't know about the built-in method.
